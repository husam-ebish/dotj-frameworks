# DJ-036 .j Swagger: architecture decisions

**Mandatory owner requirement: exact .NET names and concepts.** Preserve upstream public names, casing, namespaces, interface prefixes, method/Async suffixes and familiar workflows. Internal labels below do not authorize replacement public APIs. Apply [DOTNET-API-EXACT-001](../../08-DOTNET-API-COMPATIBILITY-POLICY.md) and this repository’s [API-COMPATIBILITY.md](API-COMPATIBILITY.md).

Status: provisional planning decisions, reviewable without starting implementation. No additional user answer is required to complete these written plans.

| ADR | Decision | Reason | Reopen when |
|---|---|---|---|
| A01 | JDK 25 non-preview as the portable desktop/server language/API proposal; exact binary lock remains required | Avoid framework substitution and preview API dependency | Platform backend requires a smaller language/API subset or vendor qualification fails |
| A02 | Own this product behavior; reuse JDK primitives and explicitly reviewed narrow platform/native dependencies | Generate and serve OpenAPI descriptions from .j endpoints with interactive documentation integration. | A dependency cannot meet required semantics or redistribution obligations |
| A03 | Use the contract/module split in JAVA-ARCHITECTURE | Separate portable behavior from integrations and lifecycle ownership | Swagger UI and OpenAPI model dependencies may live outside this repo; decide whether to port UI behavior or approve assets individually. |
| A04 | Preserve exact upstream public names, casing, concepts and workflows; isolate Java syntax/implementation differences | Preserve schema customization and endpoint discovery behavior, not ASP.NET reflection APIs. Swagger UI licensing/assets need explicit provenance. | Source audit discovers a missing family or incompatible assumption |
| A05 | Treat sampled source pin as analysis evidence; qualify a release/oracle before source-derived implementation | Default branch and root license are insufficient release evidence | E01 selects a different immutable release or resolves rights |
| A06 | Use owned neutral fixture format and standalone bootstrap runner | Avoid circular reliance on unfinished SDK/test/registry products | The shared runners can consume the same fixtures without semantic changes |

## Product-specific planning decisions

Agree shared schema/document model, then endpoint extraction and filters, then separately reviewed UI packaging.

Scope census: endpoint-inspection, schema-generation, document-filters, UI-host, CLI.

Each WP must append its API signatures, state transitions, serialization/storage schema where applicable and failure/cleanup examples to these decisions before its implementation begins. The names in this package are sufficient for work decomposition, not a substitute for compiler-level public API review.

## A07: exact .NET public API identity

Status: **owner-required**. Public spelling, casing, namespaces and concepts follow the selected upstream profile exactly. Prior Java-style public naming proposals are superseded. Internal labels may remain private; language/JVM conflicts are explicit blockers. [Policy](../../08-DOTNET-API-COMPATIBILITY-POLICY.md). No feature may satisfy compatibility solely by offering similar behavior through different public names.
