# DJ-050 .j XTest: work packages

This is the complete authored work breakdown for the retained capability families. All packages are **NOT STARTED** as implementation. Evidence gates are work, not hidden assumptions. Deliver one vertical feature slice at a time after its prerequisites; whole-product completion is not required to begin independent eligible slices.

## E01: qualify source, release and rights

Owner role: repository maintainer with licensing reviewer where required. Inputs: PINNED-UPSTREAM and DEPENDENCIES-AND-LICENSES. Tasks: choose the reference release/profile; verify immutable archive and submodules; resolve source reuse and notice obligations; lock the C# oracle and Java binary/toolchain. Outputs: baseline-lock.json, eligibility record and exact reproduction command. Acceptance: no moving refs; all required inputs have hashes; a runnable reference baseline or explicitly justified alternative oracle exists; rights-blocked work remains blocked.

## E02: close semantic inventory and dependencies

Owner role: API/build maintainer. Prerequisite: E01 analysis identity; eligibility required before restricted reuse. Tasks: evaluate all conditional project references and generated inputs; extract public API symbols with signatures and target conditions; map every source module/member to a feature package; classify missing upstream sources/native/assets. Outputs: semantic inventory, resolved dependency graph, source-to-feature ledger and API contract diffs. Acceptance: every listed module and discovered generated family has a disposition; unresolved behavior is tracked rather than omitted; base artifact dependency graph is acyclic.

## E03: establish executable fixtures and contract acceptance

Owner role: compatibility/test maintainer. Prerequisites: E01 and the relevant E02 slice. Tasks: discover true upstream test IDs; map source tests to the designed fixture IDs; run and retain reference outputs; review state transitions, error/cleanup rules and Java adaptations. Outputs: versioned fixture corpus, oracle result manifest and reviewed contract for the first slice. Acceptance: fixtures reproduce under locked inputs; no synthetic ID is presented as an upstream test; deviations and untested cases are explicit.

## Feature package order

Numbers give the proposed review/integration sequence. Independent contract research can proceed in parallel; this is not an invented delivery calendar. Each package requires E01-E03 for its own slice and only the actual predecessor contracts it consumes. Use stubs strictly for contract tests, never as proof of compatibility.

### WP-01: Discovery attributes and test identity

**Objective:** deliver the behavior represented by TestCaseId, Fact, Theory, DiscoveryMessage.

**Prerequisites:** E01; relevant E02/E03 closure; shared core/toolchain contract baseline. Proposed product edges: core. Native/asset/protocol feasibility gates apply only to the affected adapter.

**Tasks:**

1. `DJ-050-WP-01-T1`: Map xUnit-style test metadata into Java annotations.
1. `DJ-050-WP-01-T2`: Separate discovery from execution and avoid static initialization.
1. `DJ-050-WP-01-T3`: Create stable IDs including parameter cases and source identity.

**Outputs:** a versioned contract/ADR for this capability; proposed Java module(s) from JAVA-ARCHITECTURE; owned implementation after authorization; mapped upstream and designed acceptance fixtures; a migration example; dependency/notice updates for newly introduced inputs.

**Acceptance:** Discovery is deterministic; malformed theories report discovery errors; IDs stay stable under unrelated source changes.

**Validation:** run this package’s `DJ-050-F01-NN` fixtures in TEST-PORT-MAP, relevant source regressions, and applicable failure/concurrency/platform scenarios. Any missing oracle or prerequisite produces a visible blocked result.

**Integration/rollback:** publish contract and implementation changes together; retain fixture/schema versioning; reject incompatible persisted data or wire changes explicitly; preserve the preceding verified artifact for rollback. Database/schema rollback is capability-specific and cannot be assumed automatically reversible.

### WP-02: Fixtures lifetime and execution

**Objective:** deliver the behavior represented by TestContext, FixtureScope, ExecutionResult.

**Prerequisites:** E01; relevant E02/E03 closure; accepted preceding contracts through WP-01 only where consumed. Proposed product edges: core. Native/asset/protocol feasibility gates apply only to the affected adapter.

**Tasks:**

1. `DJ-050-WP-02-T1`: Define test/class/collection fixture creation and cleanup.
1. `DJ-050-WP-02-T2`: Specify async tests timeouts skips and cancellation.
1. `DJ-050-WP-02-T3`: Capture multiple teardown failures without losing primary error.

**Outputs:** a versioned contract/ADR for this capability; proposed Java module(s) from JAVA-ARCHITECTURE; owned implementation after authorization; mapped upstream and designed acceptance fixtures; a migration example; dependency/notice updates for newly introduced inputs.

**Acceptance:** Fixtures dispose once; failed setup prevents test body; teardown errors remain visible beside assertion failure.

**Validation:** run this package’s `DJ-050-F02-NN` fixtures in TEST-PORT-MAP, relevant source regressions, and applicable failure/concurrency/platform scenarios. Any missing oracle or prerequisite produces a visible blocked result.

**Integration/rollback:** publish contract and implementation changes together; retain fixture/schema versioning; reject incompatible persisted data or wire changes explicitly; preserve the preceding verified artifact for rollback. Database/schema rollback is capability-specific and cannot be assumed automatically reversible.

### WP-03: Assertions and data theories

**Objective:** deliver the behavior represented by AssertionFailure, DataProvider, ComparisonPolicy.

**Prerequisites:** E01; relevant E02/E03 closure; accepted preceding contracts through WP-02 only where consumed. Proposed product edges: core. Native/asset/protocol feasibility gates apply only to the affected adapter.

**Tasks:**

1. `DJ-050-WP-03-T1`: Implement assertion families with useful structural diffs.
1. `DJ-050-WP-03-T2`: Enumerate theory data under explicit resource ownership.
1. `DJ-050-WP-03-T3`: Define equality floating-point exception and asynchronous assertion semantics.

**Outputs:** a versioned contract/ADR for this capability; proposed Java module(s) from JAVA-ARCHITECTURE; owned implementation after authorization; mapped upstream and designed acceptance fixtures; a migration example; dependency/notice updates for newly introduced inputs.

**Acceptance:** Failure output identifies first meaningful difference; data streams close; async exceptions are observed rather than lost.

**Validation:** run this package’s `DJ-050-F03-NN` fixtures in TEST-PORT-MAP, relevant source regressions, and applicable failure/concurrency/platform scenarios. Any missing oracle or prerequisite produces a visible blocked result.

**Integration/rollback:** publish contract and implementation changes together; retain fixture/schema versioning; reject incompatible persisted data or wire changes explicitly; preserve the preceding verified artifact for rollback. Database/schema rollback is capability-specific and cannot be assumed automatically reversible.

### WP-04: Runner protocols parallelism and reporting

**Objective:** deliver the behavior represented by RunnerMessage, ExecutionCollection, ReportWriter.

**Prerequisites:** E01; relevant E02/E03 closure; accepted preceding contracts through WP-03 only where consumed. Proposed product edges: core. Native/asset/protocol feasibility gates apply only to the affected adapter.

**Tasks:**

1. `DJ-050-WP-04-T1`: Define message ordering and process isolation.
1. `DJ-050-WP-04-T2`: Schedule collections with explicit parallelism rules.
1. `DJ-050-WP-04-T3`: Emit machine-readable reports and stable exit codes.

**Outputs:** a versioned contract/ADR for this capability; proposed Java module(s) from JAVA-ARCHITECTURE; owned implementation after authorization; mapped upstream and designed acceptance fixtures; a migration example; dependency/notice updates for newly introduced inputs.

**Acceptance:** A crashed worker is distinguishable from failed tests; nonparallel collections are honored; report totals reconcile with discovered/executed cases.

**Validation:** run this package’s `DJ-050-F04-NN` fixtures in TEST-PORT-MAP, relevant source regressions, and applicable failure/concurrency/platform scenarios. Any missing oracle or prerequisite produces a visible blocked result.

**Integration/rollback:** publish contract and implementation changes together; retain fixture/schema versioning; reject incompatible persisted data or wire changes explicitly; preserve the preceding verified artifact for rollback. Database/schema rollback is capability-specific and cannot be assumed automatically reversible.

### WP-05: Bootstrap and upstream conformance

**Objective:** deliver the behavior represented by StandaloneRunner, CompatibilityFixture, Adapter.

**Prerequisites:** E01; relevant E02/E03 closure; accepted preceding contracts through WP-04 only where consumed. Proposed product edges: core. Native/asset/protocol feasibility gates apply only to the affected adapter.

**Tasks:**

1. `DJ-050-WP-05-T1`: Bootstrap assertions/runner with javac and plain Java mains.
1. `DJ-050-WP-05-T2`: Port discovery fixture assertion and runner regressions.
1. `DJ-050-WP-05-T3`: Add SDK/IDE adapters only after standalone execution works.

**Outputs:** a versioned contract/ADR for this capability; proposed Java module(s) from JAVA-ARCHITECTURE; owned implementation after authorization; mapped upstream and designed acceptance fixtures; a migration example; dependency/notice updates for newly introduced inputs.

**Acceptance:** No JUnit engine supplies the implementation; self-tests include an independent subprocess oracle; adapter failures cannot masquerade as green tests.

**Validation:** run this package’s `DJ-050-F05-NN` fixtures in TEST-PORT-MAP, relevant source regressions, and applicable failure/concurrency/platform scenarios. Any missing oracle or prerequisite produces a visible blocked result.

**Integration/rollback:** publish contract and implementation changes together; retain fixture/schema versioning; reject incompatible persisted data or wire changes explicitly; preserve the preceding verified artifact for rollback. Database/schema rollback is capability-specific and cannot be assumed automatically reversible.

## Q01: integrated qualification and release handoff

Prerequisites: all advertised feature packages and their dependency gates. Tasks: run compatibility matrix and clean builds; validate notices/SBOM and platform artifacts; review security-sensitive paths and performance evidence; verify examples/migration guides and versioning; produce exact supported/deferred/blocked capability list. Outputs: release evidence manifest, compatibility profile and release checklist. Acceptance: no unsupported feature is advertised; all claimed fixtures pass on the declared matrix; every shipped input has provenance/rights evidence; reproducible build differences are explained. Publication is a later action, not performed by this plan.
